  title: Multi-zone failure tolerance for prod high availability
  category: reliability
  priority: P0
  confidence: 0.75
  when:
    all:
      - field: environment
        op: eq
        value: prod
      - field: availability_target
        op: in
        value: ["high", "mission_critical"]
  recommendation: Deploy across multiple failure domains with health checks and automated failover.
  rationale: High availability targets require tolerance to single-zone failures.
  tradeoffs:
    - Higher cost due to redundancy.
    - More components to operate.
