  title: Elastic scaling for spiky traffic

    any:
      - field: traffic_profile
        op: eq
        value: spiky
  recommendation: Prefer autoscaling or serverless-style execution to match demand and reduce idle cost.
  rationale: Spiky demand makes fixed capacity wasteful or unreliable.
  tradeoffs:
    - Cold starts (for some serverless patterns).
    - Stateful workloads need extra design.
